If you want to output a video with just the keypoints and no background run "plot.py" and follow the instructions 

Follow this when choosing video:
1.) Move a folder (not specific file) that is full of the OpenPose output Jsons into the folder titled "output_json1"
2.) Follow instructions after running program and enjoy :)
